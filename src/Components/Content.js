      <p>Introduction: A Guide for Adaptive Apparel
      Design and Soft Goods Product Developers</p>
      <p>The Need
More than one billion people, around 15% of the world population, have some form of disability (temporary or permanent) (World Health Organization, 2020). The adaptive clothing market is currently underserved in the apparel marketplace (Mallon, 2019). However, the adaptive clothing market is estimated
to grow to nearly $400 billion by 2026 (Gaffney, 2019). In the US, apparel retailers are launching brand
extensions and offering adaptive apparel to aid disabled individuals with clothing options (Weinswig &
Schmidt, 2021). Apparel design and soft goods product developers need specialized skills and knowledge
to design and soft goods product development apparel for individuals experiencing a disability. There is
a wide range of disabilities and students need to understand how specific disabilities impact a clientâ€™s
clothing needs. For example, many disabilities result in non-traditional body types/shapes or require the
individual to be seated (Gaffney, 2019). Additionally, cognitive disabilities require understanding sensory apparel problems associated with fabrics, seams, or labels. Apparel designers and soft-good product
developers need to be prepared to design for the adaptive apparel market and educators need resources
to teach their students these skills. </p>
